    <p>M. Suganth of The Times of India gave 2.5 out of 5 and stated "Except for Nalan Kumarasamy and Gautham Menon's works, the anthology is underwhelming."[14] Ranjani Krishnakumar of Firstpost gave 3.5 out of 5 and wrote "Within the constraints of an urban, middle class, heterosexual romance, Kutty Story is an interesting mix of shorts."[15] Srinivasa Ramanujam of The Hindu wrote "Nalan Kumarasamy and Gautham Menon deliver what is expected of them in this Tamil anthology, but there’s not much beyond that."[16] Haricharan Pudipeddi of Hindustan Times reviewed "Kutty Story is a cocktail of love stories with some quirky twists. Except for Nalan’s refreshing short on male insecurity in a marriage, other shorts come across as promising but never work wholesomely."[17]

        Behindwoods gave the film 2.75 out of 5 and stated "Kutty Story is a worthy romantic anthology with interesting scripts."[18] Sify gave a rating of 3 out of 5 stating "Kutty Story's best episode belongs to Nalan Kumarasamy but the rest of the stories fail to excite us much."[19] Indiaglitz gave 3 out of 5 to the film stating "Kutty Story with a top notch cast and crew is needless to add that the technical aspects of all the four stories are of the highest quality. Though the stories work within themselves and are also fairly engaging one cannot fault the audiences for expecting much better than whats on show considering the big names involved."[20]</p>
